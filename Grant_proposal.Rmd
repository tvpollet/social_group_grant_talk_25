## Methodology

* I really, really like 'quirky' quantitative methods.

--

* Interested in metrics and rankings --> particular their uncritical use.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaXU0NmJqaHlrem5lYW1lZmpmOXp6amJwa2x1b211eW8za2dvZXR3dCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/7rfwKxzvH22cg/giphy.gif") 
```

---
## Ubiquitous rankings

* Top Lists (Songs, Drafts in sports, Movies, Places to visit)

--

* University of the Year... . (Times Higher Education, QS, Shanghai)

--

* Happiest country / Healthiest country / etc.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

```

---
## Found a hammer...

* [Robust Ranking Aggregation (RRA) Method](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245923121861). 

--> Use case: Meta-analysis of gene lists. -- How to synthesise across many lists of varying length


```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZGxnczQyNXNlMTJucnYxODk3eXUxN3JiN3plamV1Yjl0b3NsamtjNCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/10dHotK4K8R0AM/giphy.gif") 
```

---
## Current work on rankings

* [Preprint on Guardian and Complete University Guide rankings](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/fdkj5_v1) - discrepancies between institution and subject rankings.

--

* Working on draft on GPA rank in REF (Times Higher Education Rankings)

```{r, out.width = "350px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("ucl_kings.jpeg") # from UCL meme FB group
```

???
Some correspondence! But not when it comes to movements up and down ... .

---
## Just a sliver from that working draft

GPA ranking (129 institutions) and a Robust Ranking Aggregation (RRA) method across units of assessment.

## Target Leverhulme / ESRC secondary data analysis

* Expand on this work

--

* Pragmatically: I need to bring in some funds.

```{r out.width="400px", echo=F, fig.align="center"}

```


---
## Core idea

Let's use simulations to better understand the nature of rankings.

--

We will borrow from literature on animal dominance hierarchies. **Wait for it**

```{r out.width="350px", echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("grok_animal_hierarchy.jpg")
```


---
## Why? Rankings are typically sh*t

* Don't convey much information on gaps between top and bottom. Inequality

--

* Typically stationary -- movements hard to distinguish from noise?

--

--> We could do better as a lot of smart people have worked on how to generate rankings hierarchies!

---
## Animal hierarchy work

Three descriptors:

* **Steepness**:

Degree to which dominant individuals monopolize resources or control subordinates.

* **Linearity**: 

Each individual dominates those below and is subordinate to those above (A > B > C > D). Common in many species (e.g., wolves).

Non-linear: Some relationships violate the rules of transitivity (A dominates B, B dominates C, but C dominates A). (e.g., Chimpanzees, De Waal's (1982) chimpanzee's politics)

* **Temporal stability**: 

Frequent changes at the top versus rare changes.

---
## Elo Ratings 

* Arpad Elo in Chess.

--

* Elo system: skill can be represented by a single number, **a rating** 

--

* A higher rating --> greater skill. 

--

* Difference in ratings between two players predicts the expected probability of one defeating the other. 

--

After a game, ratings are updated based on the actual result compared to this expectation:

--

--> If you beat a stronger opponent, your rating increases more than if you beat a weaker one.
If you lose to a weaker opponent, your rating drops more than if you lose to a stronger one.

**Result:** a self-correcting system that converges toward a player’s true skill level over time.

---
## Common in 'sports' and e-sports

Sometimes these involve variations (Glicko / Glicko2 / Microsoft Trueskill).

* Chess / Go 

--

* E-sports (League of Legends, Halo, CS:GO)

--

Sports: Tennis, Football / Rugby, Badminton, etc

```{r, out.width = "350px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMmRsNmFvY2p4c2d0Nm04cDA2a3c0MnhmaXF3NXJla2pnc2F0a3B4dyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/t3sZxY5zS5B0z5zMIz/giphy.gif")
```

???
"_The core idea is that a rating alone doesn’t tell the full story—how confident we are in that rating matters too._" / Glicko-2 adds a third parameter: rating volatility ($\sigma$). This makes it even more sophisticated by modeling how much a player’s skill might fluctuate over time, addressing a key limitation of Glicko where skill was assumed to be relatively stable.

## Lots of work in this area... 

Likely I'll focus on `EloRatings` and `eloSteepness`

```{r out.width = "350px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("MEE_elo_steepness.png")
```

---
## My proposal

Examine hierarchies with an Elo rating approach in three domains:

* Universities based on Student satisfaction (NSS)

* Countries based on Happiness

* Countries based on self-rated health (?) --> Open to alternatives comparing hospitals? schools (OFSTED ratings)? Education in schools (PISA scores)

--> Mostly exploratory - does it change some narratives.

---
## National Student Survey

Via freedom of info requests I have obtained the **raw** data underpinning the NSS.

--> raw responses - depending on year some sociodemographics

```{r out.width = "350px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdXFmYnVtZGx1cXozaHBuc3djMnZkdHFpaXc4MGxvdzZ4ZmVzMGhpMiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/6901DbEbbm4o0/giphy.gif")
```

---
## NSS: Battle of the best

* Example of a single round: we sample a student response from psychology from Northumbria University and one from Newcastle university.

--

* We then randomly pick an NSS item which is scored 1 - 4 and the University with highest score gets the point. 

--

* repeat ad nauseam... . --> different institutions ; Like a chess or other tournament.

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

```

---
## NSS: Extensions

- We can impose further rules: e.g., full-time must play against full-time, same gender, etc. Or not specify those rules to see if it matters.

--

- Via manipulating the rules of the game we can gain insights into the limits of the system (clear win or no clear win, e.g. 2 points difference or only 1, etc)

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

## Data resource

[SHARE](https://share-eric.eu/search-results/result) : The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) 

A multidisciplinary, cross-national panel study focused on individuals aged 50 and older across 28 European countries and Israel. --> allows time component

## Self-rated Health

**General Self-Rated Health (Global SRH)**
Question: "How would you rate your health in general?"
Response Options: Respondents choose from a five-point scale:
Excellent
Very Good
Good
Fair
Poor

--

**Comparison to Others (Relative SRH)**
Question: "How would you rate your health compared to other people your age?"
Response Options: Typically a five-point scale:
Much Better
Somewhat Better
About the Same
Somewhat Worse
Much Worse


???
Details: This is a standard single-item measure, asked consistently across all waves (e.g., Wave 1 in 2004 through Wave 9 in 2023). It captures an overall subjective assessment of health, reflecting physical, mental, and functional aspects as perceived by the individual. In some waves, particularly for U.S.-harmonized versions (aligned with the U.S. Health and Retirement Study), the question may be phrased as "Would you say your health is..." with the same response scale.

Details: This item appears in certain waves (e.g., Wave 1 and subsequent waves as part of the health module) and provides a relative perspective, allowing researchers to assess how individuals perceive their health in the context of their peers. It complements the global SRH by adding a comparative dimension.

---
## SHARE expansions

* Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)

--

* Mental health measure (Euro-D)

--

* Questions about conditions

--

* Health behaviour (smoking, drinking, exercise, etc)

## SWOT --> Thomas is disgusted with himself...

* **Strengths**: Novel technique / cross-fertilisation, relatively assumption free?

--

* **Weaknesses**: 'Garbage in, Garbage out', small samples lead to pseudoreplication, Controversial?,

--

* **Opportunities**: Make some 'Shiny' Visualisations, other datasets (ELSA, etc), ... .

--

* **Threats**: Finding someone who will like this? / replacing ranking with someone else

```{r, out.width = "200px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

## Moving forward... 

* More awareness of limitations of rankings?
